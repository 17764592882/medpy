Parses the output returned by graph-\/cut implementations.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Parses the output returned by graph-\/cut implementations. When the cut module of this package has been used or a manual execution of the supported graph-\/cut algorithms has been undertaken, the functionalities provided by this module can be used to parse the results and apply it to the original images.

All functions in this module are highly depend on the actual implementation of the graph-\/cut algorithm they are intended to be used for. They require a minimal version number and it can not be ensured, that they will work with other versions.

See the package description for a list of the supported graph-\/cut implementations.

Functions: def bk\_\-mfmc\_\-parse(output): Parse the output of Boyov and Kolmogorovs max-\/flow/min-\/cut algorithm.
