Prepares, compiles and executed graph-\/cut implementations using the graphs created by the graph module of this package.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Prepares, compiles and executed graph-\/cut implementations using the graphs created by the graph module of this package. Note that the functionality provided by this module depends highly on the platform, the availability of 3rd party tools and executes foreign code. It should only be used when completely understood. Otherwise manual execution of this step is preferable.

All functions in this module are highly depend on the actual implementation of the graph-\/cut algorithm they are intended to be used for. They require a minimal version number and it can not be ensured, that they will work with other versions.

See the package description for a list of the supported graph-\/cut implementations.

Functions:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item def bk\_\-mfmc\_\-cut(source\_\-file, gpp\_\-location = False): Execute a graph cut using Boyov and Kolmogorovs max-\/flow/min-\/cut algorithm.
\end{DoxyItemize}
