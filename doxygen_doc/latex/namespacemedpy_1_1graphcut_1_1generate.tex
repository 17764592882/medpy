\subsection{Detailed Description}
Generates output files from graphs that are processable by graph-\/cut algorithms. Provides functionality to generate graphs efficiently from nD label-\/images.

All functions in this module are highly depend on the actual implementation of the graph-\/cut algorithm they are intended to be used for. They require a minimal version number and it can not be ensured, that they will work with other versions.

See the package description for a list of the supported graph-\/cut implementations.

Create a \hyperlink{}{object from a nD label image. }

Every region of the label image is regarded as a node. They are connected to their immediate neighbours by arcs. If to regions are neighbours is determined using ndim$\ast$2-\/connectedness (e.g. 3$\ast$2=6 for 3D). In the next step the arcs weights (n-\/weights) are computed using the supplied boundary\_\-term function.

Implicitly the graph holds two additional nodes: the source and the sink, so called terminal nodes. These are connected with all other nodes through arcs of an initial weight (t-\/weight) of zero. All regions that are under the foreground markers are considered to be tightly bound to the source: The t-\/weight of the arc from source to these nodes is set to a maximum (\hyperlink{}{value. The same goes for the background markers: The covered regions receive a maximum ( Graph.MAX) t-\/weight for their arc towards the sink.   If a region is marked as both, foreground and background, the background marker is given higher priority.   all arcs whose weight is not explicitly set are assumed to carry a weight of zero.   label\_\-image The label image as an array containing uint values. : The region labels have to start from 1 and be continuous ( relabel()).  label\_\-image numpy.ndarray  fg\_\-markers The foreground markers as binary array of the same shape as the label image.  fg\_\-markers ndarray  bg\_\-markers The background markers as binary array of the same shape as the label image.  bg\_\-markers ndarray  regional\_\-term This can be either False -\/ all t-\/weights are set to 0, except for the nodes that are directly connected to the source or sink. , or a function -\/ The supplied function is used to compute the t\_\-edges. It has to have the following signature regional\_\-term(label\_\-image, regions, bounding\_\-boxes, regional\_\-term\_\-args), and is supposed to return a dictionary with region-\/ids as keys and a tuple (source\_\-t\_\-weight, sink\_\-t\_\-weight) as values. The returned dictionary does only need to contain entries for nodes where one of the t-\/weights is not zero. Additional parameters can be passed via the regional\_\-term\_\-args argument.  regional\_\-term function  boundary\_\-term This can be either False -\/ In which case the weight of all n\_\-edges i.e. between all nodes that are not source or sink, are set to 0. , or a function -\/ In which case it is used to compute the edges weights. The supplied function has to have the following signature fun(label\_\-image, boundary\_\-term\_\-args), and is supposed to return a dictionary with the graphs edges as keys and their n-\/weights as values. These weights are tuples of numbers assigning the weights in both directions of the edge. Additional parameters can be passed via the boundary\_\-term\_\-args argument.  boundary\_\-term function  regional\_\-term\_\-args Use this to pass some additional parameters to the regional\_\-term function.  boundary\_\-term\_\-args Use this to pass some additional parameters to the boundary\_\-term function.   the created graph  graph.Graph   AttributeError If an argument is maleformed.
