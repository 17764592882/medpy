======================================
Installing MedPy with Python 3 support
======================================
MedPy was designed for Python 2 and the conversion to Python 3 is still in process. But large parts of the libraries are functional after an automatic code conversion. If you use Python 3, simply follow the normal installation instructions but use the following commands to pull/install the **MedPy** package itself.

With *pip*

.. code-block:: bash

    (sudo) pip install https://github.com/loli/medpy/archive/Release_0.3.0p3.zip
    
With *git*

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone -b Release_0.3.0p3 https://github.com/loli/medpy.git
